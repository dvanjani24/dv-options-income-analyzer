DV Options Income Analyzer
===============================================================================

The **DV Options Income Analyzer** serves as an investment research tool for investors who are interested in deploying **low-risk options trading strategies for the core purposes of generating passive income and maintaining healthy portfolio management.**

Options trading is commonly perceived as highly risky and speculative style of investing. Unfortunately, like many stereotypes, this perception may not be completely off the mark. As retail interest in investing continues to surge, less-experienced traders can find themselves enamored by the mindblowing potential % returns that options can offer off a limited amount of capital. Ironically, the intent for options was actually to serve as a tool to hedge risk against large movements in share prices. But, there's no fun in solely following the intent of anything in this world, is there?! Especially if an alternative use-case that can make you money for limited risk exists. 

Well-tested options strategies such as: selling covered calls, selling cash-secured puts, vertical spreads, and the iron condor, if deployed smartly, can offer a risk-minimal way to generate additional yield/income for investor portfolios. **The DV Options Income Analyzer eliminates the busy work of checking the plethora of options chain and greek data across various tickers and expiry dates and recommends risk-optimized contracts for writing calls and puts.**

**High-level Functionality**: The program prompts users to input a stock portfolio or watchlist and generates an excel-based report that recommends risk-minimized Put and Call option contracts that can be shorted by the user on their desired brokerage account for the core purpose of generating income through premiums.
